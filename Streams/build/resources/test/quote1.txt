IntelliJ IDEA editor is a powerful tool for
creating and modifying source code. As any other IDE editor,
it supports basic features like bookmarks, breakpoints, syntax highlighting, code completion, zooming, folding code
blocks, etc. There are, however, plenty of advanced features like macros, highlighted TDO items, code analysis,
intention actions, intelligent and fast navigation, and a lot more.
